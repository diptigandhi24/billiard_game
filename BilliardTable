 why the world object is local and not self?
 	Because in my game i need only one world object . I didnt made it self because  i will need only one instance of BilliardTable class for the entire game and one physics world


 If you print something inthe class and in the main class, then the printing order will start from class and then the main class, 
 this shows the execution order of the programm also. i.e main is always executed inthe end
